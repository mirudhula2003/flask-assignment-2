3. Calculator App
 Task: Build a simple calculator that can add two numbers.
 Requirements: Create a form where users enter two numbers. Display the result on
submission.
 Hint: Use HTML forms and handle data in Flask using the request.form method to
get the inputs.

4. Mini To-Do List

 Requirements: Display one random quote from a list of quotes every time the user
visits the /quote page.
 Hint: Use Python’s random.choice() to select a quote from a list and display it
using HTML.

6. Simple Login Page
